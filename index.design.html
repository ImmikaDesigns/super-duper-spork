<h3 class="post-title">Becoming a Web Developer</h3>
<p>If someone had told me a few weeks ago that I would be able to make a website, 
I would not have believed them. Being of Generation X, 46 years old, this sort of technology was 
not around for most of my life.<p>
<br>
<p>I had dabbled in apps like Shopify and was totally confused by the jargon involved in
creating a successful website store.</p>
<br>
<p>More recently, I found WordPress to be more user friendly, but was curious about the html mode. And what
was meant by snippets and widgets?!</p>
<br>
<p>Well, eventually I found <a href="getmimo.com">Mimo</a> and now things are making sense, and...
here I am, creating a real blog from scratch!

<p>From knitter to photographer, digital artist, and now an aspiring web developer.
Who knew life in the outback could lead me to this?
